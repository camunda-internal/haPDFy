      A support contact is a technical person within your organization that becomes an internal expert for Camunda and can provide internal support for your engineers, while interacting with the Camunda support on all more advanced questions or bug reports.
    </p>
    <p>With our service level agreement we define a fixed number of named employees as exclusive contacts for support requests. The number of support contacts can be increased at any time by updating your contract accordingly. Changing a designated contact person is possible if the person left the licensee’s organization or took a different job.</p>
  </div>

<div id="contact">
  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>The general way to contact our support team is our JIRA Support Desk:
    <a href="https://app.camunda.com/jira/browse/SUPPORT">https://app.camunda.com/jira/browse/SUPPORT</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Please note that we prefer JIRA for support tickets. With JIRA your tickets are traceable, your tickets
    can contain much more information in a structured way and you get a better overview about the
    status of your support cases. JIRA tickets can be shared with your colleagues and serve as database
    for you.</p>
